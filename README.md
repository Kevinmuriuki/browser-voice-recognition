# Gedion application
Gedion app is a browser speech recognition and speech synthesis application created using JavaScript.
I came up with the idea after watching the flash and realised with JavaScript I had the powers to create my own app that I can speak to.

## How the app works
As of now I have set some command that you can say to Gedion and what she will say back to you manually, but I hope with time I wil be in a position to create her to inteligently come up with her own words
Some of the commands are:
- hello Gedion
- Gedion open YouTube
- my goal

These are the commands that I have set as I develop the app.
